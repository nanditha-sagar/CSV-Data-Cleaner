# ðŸ“‚ CSV Data Cleaner

A Python script I made to quickly clean up CSV files â€” it fixes column names, fills empty cells with `NULL`, removes duplicates, and shows the before/after data.

---

## ðŸš€ What it does
- Changes all column names to **UPPER CASE** with underscores  
- Replaces any missing or empty cells with **`NULL`**  
- Removes duplicate rows so the file only has unique entries  
- Prints the **before** and **after** versions of your dataset right in the terminal  
- Saves the cleaned file as a new CSV

## ðŸ›  Tech Used
- **Python**
- **Pandas**
